	For downloading reposity: git clone https://github.com/bounswe/2021SpringGroup1/tree/master
	after cloning repository, go to downloaded folder with the command: cd 2021SpringGroup1
	Our Web code is in "Web" folder. Therefore, go to that folder by typing: cd Web
	To install necessary libraries just type: yarn install
	After installing necessary libraries, the code is ready to serve but there are 2 type of serve, 1 for development, the other is for production.
	For development two commands are enough: yarn install, yarn start
